# INFO 201 Final Project


### College Score Card Data
***
Our project focuses on propestive students giving them information on universities throughout the country. It contains a multitude of information about each university. This data can help in deciding what university a prospective student may want to attend. 

### Data set
***
The data set we decided to use was provided from (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Information for the universities is provided from 2006 to 2016, however, map data is from 2015 only. 

### Approach
***
For this project it was not feasible to create separate branches to work on different aspects of this project. We divided this project into parts that each person would be assigned. The different parts would be worked on in stages, first was cleaning and wrangling the data. Next, setting up the outline of the user interace by creating the outline of the UI and adding different paragraphs and finishing touches .The following two parts were for the different vizualizations to interpret the data.

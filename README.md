#### Data set

#### Approach

For this project it was not feasible to create separate branches to work on different aspects of this project. We divided this project into parts that each person would be assigned. The different parts would be worked on in stages, first was cleaning and wrangling the data. Next, setting up the outline of the user interace for basic structure. Then, the following two parts were for the different vizualizations for interpreting the data. Lastly, adding the write project write up and adding finishing touches.

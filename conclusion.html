      One of the things that has to be considered when applying to any university is how likely you
      are to get accepted to the university that you applied to. One of the ways to check this is
      by looking at the admission rates. We decided to look at all the universities over the 10
      year time span. What was noticed is that universities that admit based on a high SAT score of
      at least 1400 have a low admission rate of under 30%. The average min acceptance rate is 24%
      for all universities across the nation and the average maximum is 95%.

      Another factor that must be considered is the SAT scores that are used in the admissions
      process. The SAT is a required exam that is usually taken in the junior or senior year of
      high school and is used in the college admissions process. The scores range from 400 to
      1600 as a combined score. We noted that SAT scores between 900 to 1200 have admission rates
      from 40% up to 100%. ALso, SAT score from 1400 - 1600 have a low admisstion rate. The minimum
      average SAT score is 840 and the maximum score is 1305 for an admitted student for all
      universities.

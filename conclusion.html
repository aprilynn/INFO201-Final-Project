      q1: What are the admission rates per university across the nation?
      One of the things that has to be considered when applying to any university is how likely you
      are to get accepted to the university that you applied to. One of the ways to check this is
      by looking at the admission rates. We decided to look at all the universities over the 10
      year time span. What was noticed is that universities that admit based on a high SAT score of
      at least 1400 have a low admission rate of under 40%. The average min acceptance rate is 24%
      for all universities across the nation and the average maximum is 95%.

          We have decided to analyze some of the most important factors involved with a decision to
          attend college. Admission rates give an idea of how many students are accepted out of
          how many have applied. SAT scores provide the average SAT score for students admitted to
          the university. Most notably the cost of attendance. Also, we wanted to explore the
          diversity among the universities.

      information we have provided is intended for persons who are looking to attend a
      university. The data spans from 2006 to 2015 which includes 7,593 observations from the
      different colleges around the US. The average number of colleges observed per year is

      We have decided to analyze some of the most important factors involved with a decision to
      attend college. Admission rates give an idea of how many students are accepted out of
      how many have applied. SAT scores provide the average SAT score for students admitted to
      the university. Most notably the cost of attendance. Also, we wanted to explore the
      diversity among the universities.
